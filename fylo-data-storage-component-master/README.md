Hello, this is the readme for the SBA326

I became more comfortable with css and html through this SBA. I used bootstrap for any stylizing that i was comfortable with. The rest I put in css. I plan to add more stylizing through bootstrap on future projects. 

Please leave any comments for me to improve.
